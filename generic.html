                    <p class="ptext">   Well, as I told you, my name is  <span class="s1"> Carla Calderón </span> and I am a <span class="s11"> Digital Communication student </span>(A cool new degree in my University) who is left 5 subjects to finish it. 
<br> Let start from the beginning. I was born in a small town from México called <span class="s2"> Cuernavaca</span>, but when I was two years old, my parents decided to move to Venezuela, a city called <span class="s10"> Maturin</span> where I grew up and have most of my memories. 
                        Growing up in a place where there is not much to do is kind of boring when you are young and interested in topics related to art. So, <span class="s3"> exploring</span> was always the best option to get to know myself, and that is what I have been doing the last few years. That is the reason you are reading this. </p> <p class="ptext">
Back in Venezuela, I started my journalism degree and then I found my interest in the advertising world, but due to the Country’s situation I took the decision to emigrate without finish it, and that is my main reason to be here in<span class="s4">Argentina </span>. I was 20 years old when I came here… and need to say that is absolutely difficult. It  felt like being tiny ant in whole different world… what experience to get out of my comfort zone and feeling insecure, but also a great opportunity to learn new thing and explore a whole new reality, it was also fascinating. 
I was sure I wanted to do something relate to design, so in 2018 I finished a<span class="s5"> graphic course </span> where I learned the basics of Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign, (maybe the idea of creating magazine’s covers have not gone of my mind) but there was something missing, so Graphic design was not completely for me, and to know what it was I continued exploring and learning.  
<span class="s6"> The 2020 </span>had come with the pandemic, and a lot of free time along with it. Last year was hard but necessary (for me) because for the first time I heard something called <span class="s7"> UX design </span> and started to research about it, finally, something I’d love to do. 
I like focusing on details from everything that surrounds me, even more when we talk about design —A consequence of being raised by an artist dad. I do not know. But yes, I am the person who moves the line because it was not in harmony. </p><p class="ptext">
<span class="s8">How did I meet Html y CSS? </span>Well, once you enter in the UX design world you start to learn concepts and I was constantly reading about web development, so again I decided to try, and do you know what? I liked it. I had to say that the degree I am doing have both subjects related to development and web design, so I had the chance to obtain knowledge through both. 
I am telling you readers all this story because is a great example of how important is to<span class="s9"> explore </span>and to find out the ways to know yourself and yes, I am far away of how I imagine my designs in the web, but I am convinced that with practices and effort it will come. 
</p> </div>
					<div class="box">
						
				
						<p>Currently I work my best with <span class="s12">Adobe XD, Illustrator, Html, CSS </span>besides of starting to learn<span class="s13"> JavaScript</span>. As I told you, I enjoy creating the “harmony” in a digital product and that is one reason to value the whole process that comes before creating it. Still, I am constantly learning concepts relate to Design Thinking and UX research. Another process that captured me and I found pretty exciting was designing animated web pages that represent innovation but with an important background of studies to make new achievements.
